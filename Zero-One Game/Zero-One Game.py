'''Alice and Bob are playing the following game:

- The game starts with a sequence of zeroes and ones.
- Alice and Bob take alternating turns, and Alice always moves first.
- During each turn, a player removes one element from the sequence that satisfies the following:
- It is not the first or last element.
- It must be surrounded by zeroes on both sides.
- The first player who can't take their turn loses the game.
- Both players always move optimally.

Alice and Bob play g games. Given the initial sequence of numbers for each game, print the name of each game's winner on a new line (i.e., Alice or Bob).'''
